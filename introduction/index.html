<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which require every American to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty <a href="../conclusion#ref9">[9]</a>. The purpose of the ACA is to make insurance more affordable by reducing insurance premiums and out-of-pocket cost for Americans who previously could not afford insurance <a href="../conclusion#ref0">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the law prevents insurance companies from denying Americans health insurance based on pre-existing conditions. Additional benefits of the ACA includes but not limited to no-cost preventative care, coverage for young adults under the age of 26, and no cancellation or lifetime limits on care.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Architecture Specification Document (ASD) is to describe the operational, system, and service views of the healthcare marketplace. The healthcare marketplace provides American individuals and families another way to purchase healthcare insurance online through state or federal healthcare marketplace. Low and middle class Americans will have the option to purchase federally regulated and subsidized insurance through the online marketplace. For individuals who fall below the Federal Poverty Level, the marketplace will help them determine the amount of subsidies or Premium Tax Credit.</p>
<p>The healthcare marketplace (referred to as the HealthCare.gov) shall provide Americans with online capabilities to compare health plans, enroll in a chosen health plan, and calculate any subsidies or credits. The marketplace shall display available plans to User based on the types of plans including Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. The marketplace shall provide an intuitive user interface that allows User to compare the different types of plans based on their medical needs. In addition, the marketplace shall provide User the option to enroll in the chosen health plan. The marketplace shall validate User’s eligibility including but not limited to the validity of the SSN, legal resident, employment status, income, and citizenship. Furthermore, the marketplace shall calculate any subsidies and/or credits that the User qualifies based on employment and income levels.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no web-based healthcare marketplaces that are available for the general public to purchase healthcare plan to meet the ACA requirements. Hence, the government is seeking a contractor to build a cloud-based healthcare marketplace that allows users to browse, apply, and purchase healthcare plans. Specifically, the healthcare marketplace needs to address the following challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide users with a user-friendly web application interface to browse, compare, apply, and purchase healthcare plans online using the Internet</li>
<li>Establish call centers including faith based organizations, government affiliates, etc. to help users requiring assistance or those who do not have sufficient Internet connection/bandwidth access to the healthcare marketplace</li>
<li>Collect and update healthcare plans from healthcare providers and make the plans available on the healthcare marketplace</li>
<li>Create login accounts for users to manage their healthcare plans and user profile</li>
<li>Ability for the user to apply for the ACA</li>
<li>Calculate healthcare subsidies in real-time as defined by the ACA requirements</li>
<li>Leverage third-party services and products to streamline the application and plan purchase process including verification and online payment services</li>
<li>Report individuals and their employers to the Internal Revenue Service</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, healthcare providers shall offer users healthcare plans through the marketplace. These plans will be received and updated by the HealthCare.gov system. Blue Point Consulting intends to leverage commercial-off-the-shelf provides and services to expedite the development effort and minimize capital cost. These third-party services include address verification and e-commerce payment.</p>
<p>The development of this healthcare marketplace will be funded through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) <a href="../conclusion#ref11">[11]</a>. Specifically, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have obligated in excess of $840 million dollars to develop the healthcare marketplace. It is the intent of the Blue Point Consulting to develop the healthcare marketplace in concert with Accenture; and to maintain the website on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Blue Point Consulting (BPC) was founded in 2005 and headquarters in Reston, Virginia as a software development company. BPC was awarded their first contract through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. BPC received Phase I and Phase II funding by the US Navy to research and develop innovative methods to seamlessly integrate a common operating picture across various government agencies using cloud-computing technologies. Through the initial SBIR program, BPC have grown to a 400 employees with annual revenue exceeding $50 million dollars. We believe with our software development and cloud-computing expertise, BPC will be able to help the Accenture team build a user-friendly, robust, and highly available online healthcare marketplace.</p>
<p>In support of this project, BPC has hired 35 new information technology professionals, in addition to our current team, to design and develop this web-based healthcare marketplace.  The team consists but not limited to a program manager, project manager, requirements analysts, system architecture, software developers, network engineers, quality assurance and control specialist, release and deployment engineers. The team will support all phases of the software development life cycle until the initial baseline release. After the initial production release, BCP will reduce the team size to address bug fixes and future enhancements and commensurate with the price schedule.</p>
<p>BPC intends to maintain and enhance the healthcare marketing place after the initial development effort. This effort is part of the three base year contract. The maintenance and enhancement of the healthcare marketplace includes new functionality, bug fixes to the website, data updates from third-party providers, generate and deliver reports to the internal revenue service, resolve account management issues, and address payment processing problems.  The intent of these services are: 1) to provide users of the healthcare marketplace with a good buying experience, 2) provider users numerous options to purchase the healthcare plans, 3) provide the latest healthcare plans and cost, 4) provide a highly-available, reliable, and intuitive application, and 5) meet the ACA requirements.</p>
<p>BPC proposed a firm-fixed priced contract to support this project, using the labor categories and software development licenses outlined in the General Administration Services (GSA) pricing. All travel expenses will be considered out-of-pocket and billed in the government as required. All hardware and server software licenses will be considered outside the scope of this project. The price proposal is a three-years base contract with five option years as specified in the cost proposal. BPC believes that we are offering the government with the best solution and best value to develop a highly robust system within a very aggressive timeframe. In addition, since BPC is a Virginia based company, this project will help generate revenue for the Commonwealth and for US small businesses.</p>
